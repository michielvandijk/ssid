Description: The package contains functions to run a dynamic spatial microsimulation model that provides income and poverty projections
    at subnational scale. It uses a spatial microsimulation approach, to derive indicators at fine spatial resolution
    (e.g. districts and municipalities)  by combining socio-economic data from a household survey (referred to as the 'seed'), with
    aggregated information on population characteristics (referred to as the 'benchmark') that is available for small geographical
    areas from the population census and other sources. An algorithm is used to reweigh the seed and match it with the benchmark
    information to derive representative small area statistics, in this case income and poverty indicators. In dynamic spatial
    microsimulation approaches, the benchmark is projected forward and new weights are computed for future periods to obtain trends in
    income distribution under different scenarios.
