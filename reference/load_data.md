# Load model input data for further processing

`load_data()` can be used to quickly load input data (e.g. subnational
statistics, maps and mappings). This can be useful to quickly inspect
the statistics or visualize a map. Data can only be loaded after data
has been created by running the pre-processing steps. See details for
allowed input.

## Usage

``` r
load_data(data, param, local = FALSE, mess = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  character vector that refers to the data that is loaded. See details
  for allowed input.

- local:

  logical; should the data be loaded into the global (`TRUE`) or local
  environment (\`FALSE). Loading data into the local environment is only
  relevant when the function is used in internal package functions.

- mess:

  logical; should a message be printed to the screen that indicates
  which dataset is loaded?
